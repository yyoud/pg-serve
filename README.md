## Goal
 This project comes to teach myself how servers, databases, pipelines, and connections really behave in practice.
 It isn't the most polished, readable, or correct code ever, but it comes as a proof of concept. 
 I myself enjoy developing and learning, thus I always aspire for improvement. 
 Frankly, I hope this just lets you see who I am and how I code.
 As of current version, this is completely unfinished, but i am developing it currently, and I hope that until june I will finish baseline development.
